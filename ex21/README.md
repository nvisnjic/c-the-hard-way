Basics.


Bit Operators

These are more advanced and for shifting and modifying the raw bits in integers.

    & (binary)  // Bitwise and.
    <<          // Shift left.
    >>          // Shift right.
    ^           // bitwise xor (exclusive or).
    |           // bitwise or.
    ~           // compliment (flips all the bits).


    ?:          // Ternary truth test, read X ? Y : Z as "if X then Y else Z".


Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators that assign a value, and/or perform an operation 
at the same time. Most of the above operations can also be combined into 
a compound assignment operator.

    =       // assign.
    %=      // modulus assign.
    &=      // bitwise and assign.
    *=      // multiply assign.
    +=      // plus assign.
    -=      // minus assign.
    /=      // divide assign.
    <<=     // shift left, assign.
    >>=     // shift right, assign.
    ^=      // bitwise xor, assign.
    |=      // bitwise or, assign.
